Hi, My name is Darcian!
This is my first TOP's project: creating a recipe website with HTML
I will be applying what I have learned so far about HTML
inluding elements, tags, HTML boilerplate, text, creating lists, and linking images.
I will be showcasing three of my favorite recipes on this website: Plov, Gumbo, and pho.
