    <p><h3>Descriptions</h3></p>
    <p> 
        Gumbo is a soup popular in the US state of Louisiana. 
        On a trip to New Orleans,I got to taste this amazing dish and ever since has become one of my favorite.
        The dish often eaten with rice and consists primarily of the Creole "holy trinity"(onion,bell pepper 
        and celery), okra, and dark roux,meat/seafood and . There are two main variations to this soup: 
        chicken and sausage,and seafood gumbo. No matter which, it can become your tasty and filling lunch or dinner.
